  <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>

  <p>This is a simple HTML page created with no frameworks or libraries.</p>

  <h2>About This Page</h2>

  <p>Here you can see examples of different HTML tags like headings, paragraphs, and images.</p>

  <h3>Learning HTML</h3>

  <p>I'm learning how to structure content with semantic HTML. It's fun and useful!</p>

  <p>More features will be added later like CSS styling and maybe some interactivity with JavaScript.</p>
